# niklasnson.github.io

This is the source for my personal blog **niklasnson.com**. It uses some unsoported plugins so it must be built localy and published to GitHub, this is done via the script `scripts/publish.sh` 

## Installation

```
  $ bundle install
```

## Create a new post
```
  $ rake new title
```

And then edit the page created in posts directory
