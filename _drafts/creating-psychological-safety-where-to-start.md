#### How to build empathy in a team?

In my opinion, there are three points that are the most important, by starting to build security we can start to be personal with each other. By being personal with each other we strengthen security. But it is also very important that everyone works towards the same goal. To feel a sense of belonging.

##### Key elements

* Build trust among the team.
* With trust we can show vulnerability – our greatest strength.
* Avoid disconnection – make sure the team have common goals.

#### Communication is key
Building trust can take time, but I've learned that it usually goes faster if someone takes the lead and starts to get very personal. And if you manage to get someone on board early on, it can become, let's call it normalized. Then it becomes easier for others to talk about private things that are beyond the surface that we usually show of ourselves.

I find that having a "check-in" during a team meeting where everyone can assess their harmful stress is a fantastic tool for building not only trust but also camaraderie and getting the team to work towards the same goal.

Of course, it has to take time, there is a barrier to being personal. All teams work differently and are in different stages. In teams that I have been most successful in, the teams that have not worked together for that long and are quite new. There is also a big difference between a team with only senior developers and teams that are more mixed. I have been surprised that teams with exclusively men enter the next phase significantly earlier than mixed teams.

This surprised me a lot. I had suspected that a mixed team would enter this second phase more quickly. Then there are a number of other advantages to a mixed team so I still believe that it is the best form.

#### Dynamics of a team with empathy

* Structure
* Forming meaningful connections
* Consistency
* Focus on self-reflection

#### Tips for activities to get you started

* Create and present a user manual to the team.
    * My name is:
    * Conditions I like to work in:
    * The time I like to work:
    * The best way to communicate with me:
    * The way I like to receive feedback:
    * The things I need to stay motivated:
    * How I learn best:
    * Things I struggle with:

* Check-in during team meetings
