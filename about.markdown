Hi! Iâ€™m Niklas Nilsson. I'm a software engineer at Ericsson where i write sofware for the gNB - for the 5g telecom systems. Iâ€™m interested in finding better ways to build maintainable software in small and efficient teams.

##### Leadership
Positive, team player and communicative leader. As a person, I am open, cooperative, extrovert and willing to work with people of different backgrounds and genders.

My ambition is to create a work environment where everyone is seen and feels committed to the common goal and everyone have a change to reach their full potential by feeling secure and heard. 

#### Opensource and Projects
My opensource projects are posted on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/niklasnson/), i have made contributions to large projects and small and built my own. 

##### Projects
Under [Projects](/projects) you can find a list of current projects im working on. Many of these projects are sharp and put in production. On my spare time i mostly work with web based projects and with Ruby On Rails.

#### Amiga and retro computing
I have a strong intrest in retro computers; specific the Commodore Amiga computers. I collect hardware and use them for games, programming and BBS:ing. 

##### C and assembler programming 
I enjoy software projects on the Amiga, mostly working in C. Also trying to explore assembler programming on the Motorola 680xx.
