I have now been using TMUX for a couple of weeks and I have found a couple of plugins that make my life much easier and thought I would take the opportunity to give you some tips and tell you about the plug-ins that I frequently use.

#### TMUX PLUGIN MANAGER
[Tmux Plugin Managerh](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) - an absolutely fantastic plug-in manager for tmux, makes it extremely easy and smooth to install or uninstall plug-ins for tmux. It really couldn't be easier. All you need to do is add a tag with the link to each plug-in you want to install and TPM will do the rest.

##### TMUX - NORD THEME
[nord theme](https://github.com/nordtheme/tmux)- if you've been following me for a while, you probably already know that I'm very fond of the Nord color theme. I find it easy to read and the syntax is clearly visible and easy to follow, for example, code.

Here you get Nord's clear palette of colors that make tmux beautiful to look at.

##### TMUX MENUS
[tmux-menus](https://github.com/jaclu/tmux-menus) - a fantastic tool that helps with all the keyboard shortcuts and functions before they are in your spine, I think it is an absolutely fantastic tool and really recommend it.

##### TMUX-YANK
[tmux-yank](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)- the first thing I had trouble with when I first started using TMUX was how easily I could copy and paste text; something I do frequently when troubleshooting systems. To be completely honest, I was about to give up; because I couldn't find a smooth way to work. It feels like this plug-in solved all my problems.

##### TMUX MIGHTY SCROLL
[tmux mighty scroll](https://github.com/noscript/tmux-mighty-scroll)- instead of having to go into copy mode to scroll, this happens automatically when you scroll up. Some people probably don't understand the benefit of this tool, but it really suits the way I work and think.
