I updated my [SDL2 Bootstrap](https://github.com/niklasnson/SDL2Bootstrap), i will start working on a small game, just to do some other programming than i normally do in C++. The game will live at [GitHub](https://github.com/niklasnson/missile_command.cpp).


My thought is to have a easy setup to start doing a new game with the basic skeleton that you might want to have.
