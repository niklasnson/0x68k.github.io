I had the honor of participating in the Regional Scrum Gathering 2024 held in September in Stockholm. A fantastic conference that gave me several new lessons, new techniques and a lot of reflections on how I want to run a team.

__Nutsa Kuprava__, an Agile Coach originally from Georgia but currently living and working in Greece. With a background in psychology, I specialize in understanding team dynamics, promoting effective teamwork, and helping teams reach their full potential in the Agile world.

Nutsa gave a fantastic presentation titled "Bringing Empathy to Agile Teams", where she went through how to get started with empathy and trust in the team. Nutsa made a big impression on me and what she presented I will take with me.

The conference contained several other really interesting lectures but these were the ones that made the most impression on me. I thought the conference was well organized and carried out in a very smooth manner. I really hope that I will be able to visit more similar conferences in the future.
