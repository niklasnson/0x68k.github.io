So we are getting close to the end of the year, this has been a year with a lot of change for me and i was thinking it would be a good idea to summarize it and look at some of the hight light's.

2024 ended with me, together with my future wife, starting and finishing our first Hyrox race. I think this was something that left a big mark on the rest of the year and in some way was the start of all the change that 2025 actually brought.

Over the year I have struggled with not knowing if I would lose my sight or if any of the various injections I have received in my eye over the year would help. I have oscillated between hope and disappointment as I have tried several different preparations but none except the last one actually seem to help. I realise that my defence against disappointment has been that I have always set myself up for it not to work.

But it was a huge relief when I received the news in October that there was a positive change in my eye. I finally got the green light to get new glasses that suited my changed vision.

##### Married
My partner and I had been talking for a long time about getting married when it was getting closer to buying a house together, more like it would make everything a little easier legally. But then we started talking about why we were actually putting it off; it would be a big deal for my mom to be there and she's not getting any younger. So we decided to do it this year and when we were looking at the plan we decided that the end of May was a perfect time and we made up our minds.

##### Changing job
I hadn't really had big plans to change jobs, but I was drawn into the feeling of being able to handle the tough challenge that Hyrox actually is and started looking around. I quickly got in touch with a consulting firm that felt right, I got a lucrative salary offer and I took the plunge. It then went by quickly before I had my first placement ready so when I left my last employer on Thursday, I got married on Friday and on Monday I started my new job.

I am now completely convinced that I made the right decision at the right time. I have been given the opportunity to further develop myself not only as an engineer but also as a team leader.

I prefer that title as I think it reflects what I do so much more than scrum master.

##### What to come
I really think that 2026 will be a very good year for me; I will continue to develop, I have a lot of goals and expectations for myself. We end the year the same way as last year; we will run one more Hyrox race. The goal is to get to the finish line in a better time than last year, next year I also want to continue to develop with my training. I have come a long way during the year but next year I will really put in an extra gear. To compete in at least two Hyrox races in 2026 is the plan - probably Copenhagen and Stockholm.
