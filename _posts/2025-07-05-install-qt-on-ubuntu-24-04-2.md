This is how i installed Qt on Ubuntu 24.04.2.

* First step go to [Qt.io](https://www.qt.io/)
* Click on the "Download. Try." button.
* Click on "Community User"
* Scroll down to "Looking for Qt Binaries" and click download"
* Download (click) the Linux button.

Now ytou will have a `qt-online-installer-linux-x64-4.10.0.run`
Make the file executable by running `chmod +x qt-online-installer-linux-x64-4.10.0.run`

You will need to create a Qt account and after this it will be installed.
