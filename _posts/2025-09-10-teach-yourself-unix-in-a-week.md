In my current role, I manage several complex systems. To understand them better, I needed to update my knowledge of system administration. After all, it has been a couple of years since I attended university.

_This teach-yourself tutorial is designed to take readers from novices to experienced users in just seven days. All the major releases are explored, as well as UNIX features, commands, and tools, for immediate productivity in the UNIX environment._

I especially appreciated a thorough review of file permissions and chmod. As well as a thorough review of the file system. I will have to go through the book again; but it was a really good read.

I found the book secondhand and didn't pay much for it; but I would actually happily pay full price for it.
