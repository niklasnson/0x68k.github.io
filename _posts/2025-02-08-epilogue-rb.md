I just started working a new project, i spent time thinking about a web based notes system for a while and im thinking it will be a fun project to do in Rails 8.0. I have started working on scaffolding the application and as soon as i have made the first basic functions i will make the code public on github.

Name on the project is epilogue.rb - i will keep you posted on updates.
