<p class="fs-5">Hi! I'm NIklas Hilding. I'm a consultant team leader and software engineer with Ericsson and Saab as my most recent placements. I’m interested in finding better ways to build maintainable software in small and efficient teams.</p>

##### Leadership
Positive, team player and communicative leader. As a person, I am open, cooperative, extrovert and eager to work with people of different backgrounds and genders. Divercity will in my eyes always be the best building block for a strong team.

My ambition is to create a work environment where everyone is seen and feels committed to the common goal and everyone have a change to reach their full potential by feeling secure and heard.

#### Opensource and Projects
My opensource projects are hosted and published on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/cube-se/), i have made contributions to large and small projects and built my own in a number of diffrent technologies and areas.

##### Projects
Under [Projects](/projects) you can find a list of current projects im working on. Many of these projects are published and put in production mode. On my spare time i mostly work with web based projects and with Ruby On Rails.

### Amiga and retro computing

I have a strong intrest in retro computers; specific the Commodore Amiga computers. I collect hardware and use them for games, programming and BBS:ing (pre-internet communication).

##### C and assembler programming
I enjoy software projects on the Amiga, mostly working in C. I have made a collection of utliities that i maintain and expand. Also trying to explore assembler programming on the Motorola 680xx. It's a dream of mine to write a game mixing Assembler and C code for the Amiga.

I have a collection of dirrent Amigas but mostly use either a Amiga 600HD or a Amiga 500 with a external harddrive.
