But you may run into issues when you use plugins that are not whitelisted by GitHub e.g the great archive gem.</p>

<p>The solution then is to build the HTML version locally and then push it to GitHub and make GitHub serve that as the webpage.</p>

<p>Im using a new branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> for this, beeing on master i run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build ~/temp_buil</code> and then i replace the content in the gh-pages branch with this. Then i publlish the branch gh-pages.</p>

<p>On GitHub go to settings, pages and select “deploy from branch” and set it to use the gh-pages branch.</p>

<p>You could turn this into a bash script.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="bash" /><category term="ruby" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="git" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jekyll and GitHub is a powerful combination, with easy you can publish a blog and the HTML will be built when you push.
