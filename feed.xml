No longer perceived as a difficult operating system, more and more users are discovering the advantages of Unix for the first time. But whether you are a newcomer or a Unix power user, you’ll find yourself thumbing through the goldmine of information in the new edition of Unix Power Tools to add to your store of knowledge. Want to try something new? Check this book first, and you’re sure to find a tip or trick that will prevent you from learning things the hard way. The latest edition of this best-selling favorite is loaded with advice about almost every aspect of Unix, covering all the new technologies that users need to know. In addition to vital information on Linux, Darwin, and BSD, Unix Power Tools 3rd Edition now offers more coverage of bash, zsh, and other new shells, along with discussions about modern utilities and applications.</p>

<p>Several sections focus on security and Internet access. And there is a new chapter on access to Unix from Windows, addressing the heterogeneous nature of systems today. You’ll also find expanded coverage of software installation and packaging, as well as basic information on Perl and Python. Unix Power Tools 3rd Edition is a browser’s book…like a magazine that you don’t read from start to finish, but leaf through repeatedly until you realize that you’ve read it all. Bursting with cross-references, interesting sidebars explore syntax or point out other directions for exploration, including relevant technical details that might not be immediately apparent. The book includes articles abstracted from other O’Reilly books, new information that highlights program tricks and gotchas, tips posted to the Net over the years, and other accumulated wisdom. Affectionately referred to by readers as “the” Unix book, UNIX Power Tools provides access to information every Unix user is going to need to know. It will help you think creatively about UNIX, and will help you get to the point where you can analyze your own problems.</p>

<p>I found the book most helpfull and i think i will use it to lookup things from time to time. Its a good complement to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ man</code> command. Found the book used and did not spend a lot of money on it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="book-review" /><category term="scripting" /><category term="linux" /><category term="unix" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing popularity of Linux and the advent of Darwin, Unix has metamorphosed into something new and exciting.

<p>In my opinion, there are three points that are the most important, by starting to build security we can start to be personal with each other. By being personal with each other we strengthen security. But it is also very important that everyone works towards the same goal. To feel a sense of belonging.</p>

<h5 id="key-elements">Key elements</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Build trust among the team.</li>
  <li>With trust we can show vulnerability – our greatest strength.</li>
  <li>Avoid disconnection – make sure the team have common goals.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="communication-is-key">Communication is key</h4>
<p>Building trust can take time, but I’ve learned that it usually goes faster if someone takes the lead and starts to get very personal. And if you manage to get someone on board early on, it can become, let’s call it normalized. Then it becomes easier for others to talk about private things that are beyond the surface that we usually show of ourselves.</p>

<p>I find that having a “check-in” during a team meeting where everyone can assess their harmful stress is a fantastic tool for building not only trust but also camaraderie and getting the team to work towards the same goal.</p>

<p>Of course, it has to take time, there is a barrier to being personal. All teams work differently and are in different stages. In teams that I have been most successful in, the teams that have not worked together for that long and are quite new. There is also a big difference between a team with only senior developers and teams that are more mixed. I have been surprised that teams with exclusively men enter the next phase significantly earlier than mixed teams.</p>

<p>This surprised me a lot. I had suspected that a mixed team would enter this second phase more quickly. Then there are a number of other advantages to a mixed team so I still believe that it is the best form.</p>

<h4 id="dynamics-of-a-team-with-empathy">Dynamics of a team with empathy</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Structure</li>
  <li>Forming meaningful connections</li>
  <li>Consistency</li>
  <li>Focus on self-reflection</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tips-for-activities-to-get-you-started">Tips for activities to get you started</h4>

<p>So you’ve decided this is the way to go, but how do you get started?</p>

<p>If there is already a sense of security in the team and you feel that you can be open with each other, I strongly believe in creating a user manual for yourself and then presenting it to the others. By opening up and telling about how we want to be contacted, how we learn or what we have difficulty with, we show vulnerability to each other and that is a fantastic component.</p>

<h6 id="user-manual">User manual</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Create and present a user manual to the team.
    <ul>
      <li>My name is:</li>
      <li>Conditions I like to work in:</li>
      <li>The time I like to work:</li>
      <li>The best way to communicate with me:</li>
      <li>The way I like to receive feedback:</li>
      <li>The things I need to stay motivated:</li>
      <li>How I learn best:</li>
      <li>Things I struggle with:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="check-ins">Check-ins</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Check-in during team meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>If the team does not have a basic trust, it is of the utmost importance that it is created before you proceed with, for example, the exercise above. I assume your team has a team meeting once a week; at the beginning of the meeting ask everyone to rate their negative stress between 1-6, everyone chooses whether they want to include private things or not. After running this for a couple of months, the meeting usually has become deeper and you can, in addition to getting closer to each other, start working on stress, task distribution.</p>

<p>However, it is very important that it does not become an environment where it is considered good to feel stress. If you start to see tendencies towards this, you must immediately address them.</p>

<p>I am open to talking about these topics if you want a deeper insight.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="psychology" /><category term="management" /><category term="words" /><category term="teamlead" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to build empathy in a team?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Teach yourself unix in a week</title><link href="https://0x68k.com/book-review/2025/09/10/teach-yourself-unix-in-a-week.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Teach yourself unix in a week" /><published>2025-09-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-09-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://0x68k.com/book-review/2025/09/10/teach-yourself-unix-in-a-week</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://0x68k.com/book-review/2025/09/10/teach-yourself-unix-in-a-week.html"><![CDATA[<p>In my current role, I manage several complex systems.

<p>One of the floppy disks that came with the 1541-II disk drive that I bought shortly after contained TASM (Turbo Assembler) and then it felt like a sign that I should get started and learn.</p>

<p>I bought a used paperback copy of the book but I can find it on e.g. <a target="_new" href="http://retro.hansotten.nl/uploads/books/Programming_the_6502.pdf">retro.hansotten.nl</a>.</p>

<p>The Commodore 64 has an 8-bit CPU, the MOS 6510, which is closely related to the MOS 6502 but with built-in support for switching the computer’s ROM in and out of the addressable address space. Therefore, I thought the book was a bargain for 35 SEK.</p>

<p>I find the book to be structured and very well-written. It is natural that the book has a strong technical content, but it is easy to follow and I feel that it also gave me a good foundation to stand on when it comes to assembly language programming.</p>

<p>This is the quintessential guide to 6502 assembly. It’s been around a long time and it’s a classic. Rodnay Zaks is the authority on early assembler development.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="book-review" /><category term="6510asm" /><category term="commodore64" /><category term="6510asm" /><category term="book" /><category term="reading" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am most motivated to learn assembler programming on the 68000, but since I recently bought a Commodore 64 after thinking about having one for a long time, I started to think a little about whether I shouldn’t take the plunge and make some of those cool effects that I saw on the screen in my boyhood room as a young man.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://0x68k.com/programming-the-6502-by-rodnay-zaks.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://0x68k.com/programming-the-6502-by-rodnay-zaks.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Life retrospective</title><link href="https://0x68k.com/words/2025/09/07/retrospective.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Life retrospective" /><published>2025-09-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2025-09-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://0x68k.com/words/2025/09/07/retrospective</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://0x68k.com/words/2025/09/07/retrospective.html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m turning 51 today, thought it could be egood idea to look at life and where I’m at. I was diagnosed with diabetes in 2022/08, to be completely honest it came very unexpectedly then. Although today I can’t understand how I couldn’t understand based on the major and serious symptoms. Constant need to pee and thirst, loss of feeling in my feet and hands. Extreme craving for sugar and cookies.</p>

<p><img width="350" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/retrospective_a.JPEG" /></p>

<p>It’s been a tough couple of years, mainly with my health fluctuating between bad and really bad. I had severe side effects from several of my medications. Sudden chills, mood swings and stomach and head pain. Constantly tired and blurred vision.</p>

<p>But what perhaps hit me the hardest was that suddenly it felt like my strength was halved, all the progress I had made in recent years was suddenly gone. This is where I decided, I would take control of my well-being and I would make sure to get in better shape than ever before. Just over a year ago I discovered Hyrox as a form of training, which has done a lot for my well-being and physical shape. But not only that, it has also helped me a lot mentally.</p>

<p><img width="350" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/img/retrospective_b.JPEG" /></p>

<h4 id="training">Training</h4>
<p>Earlier in life I focused mainly on strength, the goal of my training was to be able to lift as much as possible. Today I train differently; I notice that my diabetes and especially my blood sugar stay at a controlled level more easily if I mix strength and high-intensity running and rowing. It has really made me a lot better.</p>

<p>Now I am aiming to set an even better time in Stockholm at Hyrox 2025. I am registered with my wife and we will run together just like last year. The goal of my training is mainly to feel as good as possible, to cope with the high pace that my work requires and to find an outlet for feelings such as fear and anxiety that my condition gives me.</p>

<h4 id="career">Career</h4>
<p>I resigned from my previous employer after seven years there. It had been a great journey from working primarily as a developer to then working more as a team leader and scrum master. I discovered that it was primarily the work with the team that I found most developing and stimulating. Working with social security and succeeding in developing the team and testing new ways of working was really rewarding.</p>

<p>To get ahead in this, I chose to go to a consulting firm, I don’t regret it for a second - the new challenges that I have already encountered are enormously rewarding and make me grow as a person but also as a leader.</p>

<p>I am very much looking forward to what further challenges I will encounter.</p>

<h4 id="life">Life</h4>
<p>As for my private life, I married my partner after 12 years together. It’s probably the wisest thing I’ve done in a long time, I’m eternally grateful that we share several passions but also understand the passions that we each have and let these take their place in our lives. The fact that we’ve also found a relationship that suits us very well makes me even more secure in our love and friendship.</p>

<h4 id="retrospective-summary">Retrospective summary</h4>
<p>Life is short. Live with urgency! Don’t put off things you want to do or experience. Stop thinking that things will get better, they won’t if you don’t make active choices to change. Change costs energy and you have to dare to challenge yourself, but every time I do it I realize how much I grow and how much it gives me back.</p>

<p>I am now struggling with a complication of my diabetes that in the worst case scenario will take my sight. I have undergone several different procedures but nothing has so far stopped the bleeding and the damage that risks damaging the macula and with it my sight. What feels a little reassuring is that my right eye is in better condition than my left.</p>

<p>But I also notice that when you go through a crisis, you come out with new strengths and ways of dealing with stress and anxiety.</p>

<p>I have definitely learned more about myself through these feelings.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="words" /><category term="words" /><category term="diabetics" /><category term="life" /><category term="hyrox" /><category term="training" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m turning 51 today, thought it could be egood idea to look at life and where I’m at.

It is part of my daily work but I also do a lot of development in Python and C++, at my previous job the recommended editor was VSCodium and we had a lot of special plugins that made the work easier. That is why I chose to change my primary editor to VSCodium, I know it is not a compulsion but I have always found it easiest to work in one and the same editor both at work and in my free time.</p>

<p>But my new assignment makes it much easier to use Vim instead of any other editor. This is a small walkthrough of the configuration I use at home. Due to security class, I can’t really use the same configuration at work.</p>

<h4 id="nerdtree">NERDTree</h4>
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/2025-09-05-my-vim-configuration-and-wow_1.png" /></p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/2025-09-05-my-vim-configuration-and-wow_2.png" /></p>

<p>CtrlP is a great fuzzy file finder for Vim. As a complement to NERDtree, I think it’s perfect. When I’m comfortable in projects, it’s easier and faster to open files by name than to click through to the files.</p>

<h4 id="fzf">Fzf</h4>
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/2025-09-05-my-vim-configuration-and-wow_3.png" /></p>

<p>fzf itself is not a Vim plugin, and the official repository only provides the basic wrapper function for Vim. It’s up to the users to write their own Vim commands with it.</p>

<p>I mainly use the :Buffert function which is absolutely fantastic and makes it super easy to work with multiple files at the same time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="open-source" /><category term="project" /><category term="vim" /><category term="words" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently changed clients and now have an assignment where I configure and troubleshoot several Linux systems.
