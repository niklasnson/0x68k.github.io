<p>The action taken will be to send a mail to user asking <em>“was it you who signed in, otherwise please act”</em>.</p>

<h4 id="ruby-ipaddr">Ruby IPAddr</h4>
<p>IPAddr provides a set of methods to manipulate an IP address. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. Using the ´mask(prefixlen)´ - witch returns a new ipaddr built by masking IP address with the given prefixlen/netmask. (e.g. 8, 64, “255.255.255.0”, etc.). This can then then be used to query the database of saved IP addresses if currrent ip mask exists. If not it is a considerd a new IP address and a suspicious login.</p>

<p>The solution then is to build the HTML version locally and then push it to GitHub and make GitHub serve that as the webpage.</p>

<p>Im using a new branch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> for this, beeing on master i run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build ~/temp_buil</code> and then i replace the content in the gh-pages branch with this. Then i publlish the branch gh-pages.</p>

<p>On GitHub go to settings, pages and select “deploy from branch” and set it to use the gh-pages branch.</p>

<p>You could turn this into a bash script.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="bash" /><category term="ruby" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="git" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jekyll and GitHub is a powerful combination, with easy you can publish a blog and the HTML will be built when you push.
