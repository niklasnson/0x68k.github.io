  project: "Epilogue"

  project: "Epilogue"
  description: "One of the major uses of Epilogue is to be able to collaborate on clipboards together and then it is important that the latest version is always presented to all users. In addition, the fact that multiple users can update different parts of the document places a lot of demands on how and when the update is made. This will be one of the major technical challenges around this project."

  project: "Epilogue"

  description: "I find that today we often lean towards the fact that most people today have very fast internet even on their phones; and we send unnecessarily large images to devices that could do just fine with a significantly smaller image. Based on the terminal that will receive the image, the data that goes over the wire should not be larger than the maximum image that a receiving device is capable of displaying."
